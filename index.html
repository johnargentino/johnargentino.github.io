I'm a PhD Candidate in the [Mathematics Department](https://sse.tulane.edu/math) at Tulane University researching statistical methods for modeling food security and community resiliency. I have been a Teaching Assistant for Stats for Scientists and Intro to Statistical Inference, as well as the instructor for Probability and Statistics.
